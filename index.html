  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome! This is my professional early childhood education website featuring my teaching philosophy,
    family resources, and educator competencies.
  </p>

  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe children learn best through play, exploration, and supportive relationships.
    My goal is to create a safe, inclusive environment that supports social-emotional growth and early learning.
